About SkillLink
----------------
SkillLink is an innovative platform designed to connect learners with experienced mentors across a variety of industries. Our mission is to bridge the gap between education and real-world experience, enabling learners to acquire practical skills, gain guidance from professionals, and achieve their career goals faster.

We created SkillLink because we noticed that while many talented individuals seek guidance, it’s often hard to find mentors in a structured and accessible way. We wanted to build a platform that makes mentorship easy, organized, and impactful, whether you’re a student, professional, or lifelong learner.
As college students, most of us seniors, we know the importance of being able to have a platform to find employers who can be mentors as we go through our search for a meaningful career. 

Meaning of the Name
-------------------
The name "SkillLink" reflects our core idea: linking people to skills. Each connection on the platform is designed to help learners develop new abilities, gain knowledge, and build confidence in their chosen field. The “Link” emphasizes collaboration, guidance, and networking, while “Skill” highlights personal and professional growth.
